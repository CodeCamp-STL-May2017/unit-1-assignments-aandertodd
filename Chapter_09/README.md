# Weekly Graded Assignment Instructions

Write a function that mirrors its argument. For example, ``mirror('good')`` should return a string holding the value ``gooddoog``. (Hint: Make use of the ``reverse`` function that you wrote in exercise 3 in the book.)

There is *one additional condition* to take into account: if the test string contains the lowercase letter ``'a'``, then the mirror function should return a string that is ALL CAPS. For example, ``mirror('abc')`` should return a string holding the value ``ABCCBA``.
