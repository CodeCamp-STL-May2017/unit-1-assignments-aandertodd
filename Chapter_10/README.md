# Weekly Graded Assignment Instructions

Write a function to find the average of the numbers in a list after the highest and lowest valued numbers have been removed. (You can assume both that no number will appear more than once in the list and that you will not be given an empty list.) For example, given a list of ``[24,1,10,4,38,2]`` the numbers ``1`` and ``38`` should be removed and the average of the remaining numbers should be returned (in this case, the average is 10).
